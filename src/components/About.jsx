              Well, Iâ€™ve been working on web development for two years now,
              while still studying at college. Had my own projects, coded mostly
              in Python,Now I am looking to get a job with an innovative game
              studio, and am glad to be interviewing with you here. Apart from
              coding, I enjoy reading a good book, or a nice evening out with
              friends. That would do for a short introduction.
